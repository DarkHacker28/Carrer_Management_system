# Project Overview : 

The Career Management System is a web-based platform designed to manage and streamline career planning, job applications, and user profiles. It provides functionalities for job seekers, recruiters, and administrators, making career management efficient and organized.

# The system is built using a combination of technologies :

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Java (JSP, Servlets)

Database: Oracle SQL

XML: Used for configuration and data representation

C++ Libraries: Integrated for certain algorithmic computations

Other Tools: JDBC for database connectivity, and additional libraries for optimized performance.
 
# Key Features :
User Registration and Authentication

Secure registration and login system for users (Job Seekers, Recruiters, Admins).
Profile Management

Users can create, view, and update their career profiles.
Job Management

Recruiters can post job openings, and job seekers can search and apply for jobs.
Resume Upload and Tracking

Upload resumes in various formats.
Track the status of job applications.

Career Guidance System

Automated recommendations for career paths based on user skills and interests.
Search and Filter Functionality

Efficient search for job postings, profiles, and career-related resources.
Database Integration

Uses Oracle SQL to manage large-scale job and user data.
Supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

XML Configuration

XML used for system settings, data interchange, and structured configuration.

C++ Integration

C++ libraries for backend computations like skill matching, ranking candidates, and career suggestions.
